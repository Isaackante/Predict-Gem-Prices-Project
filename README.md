Gem Price Prediction using TensorFlow Keras with ReLU and RMSprop Activation Functions
This is a project for predicting the price of a gemstone using TensorFlow Keras with ReLU and RMSprop activation functions. The dataset used for this project is a collection of historical data of various gemstones and their prices. The aim of the project is to build a model that can predict the price of a gemstone based on its characteristics, such as carat weight, cut, clarity, and color.

Dependencies
TensorFlow 2.0 or higher
Pandas
NumPy
Data
The dataset used in this project is provided in CSV format and contains the following columns:

carat_weight: weight of the gemstone in carats
cut: quality of the cut (Fair, Good, Very Good, Premium, Ideal)
color: color of the gemstone (D, E, F, G, H, I, J)
clarity: clarity of the gemstone (I1, SI1, SI2, VS1, VS2, VVS1, VVS2, IF)
price: price of the gemstone in USD

The gem price prediction model is built using TensorFlow Keras with ReLU and RMSprop activation functions. The model consists of three layers: an input layer, a hidden layer, and an output layer. The input layer has four nodes, one for each characteristic of the gemstone. The hidden layer has 2 nodes and uses the ReLU activation function. The output layer has one node and uses a linear activation function.

Training the Model
The gem price prediction model is trained using the RMSprop optimizer with a learning rate of 0.001 and a mean squared error loss function. The model is trained for 250 epochs with a batch size of 32.

Evaluating the Model
The model is evaluated on a test set of data that was not used in training. The mean absolute error and the mean squared error are calculated to assess the performance of the model.

Conclusion
The gem price prediction model built using TensorFlow Keras with ReLU and RMSprop activation functions is able to predict the price of a gemstone based on its characteristics with reasonable accuracy. With further optimization, the model can be improved to achieve even better performance.
